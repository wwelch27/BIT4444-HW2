        The BIT Department offers two degree options for its undergraduate major in Business Information
        Technology. Both options are focused on learning how to effectively use computers and analytical
        problem-solving techniques to support decision-making in a business environment:

      <p class="concentration" id="dss">
        The decision support systems option educates the student in the design, implementation and use of computerized systems
        that support business managers in the decision-making process. A decision support system (DSS) is a computer system that
        typically encompasses mathematical models as well as informational databases and a user interface in order to provide
        recommended decisions to manager-users.
      </p>
      <p class="concentration" id="osm">
        The operations and supply chain management (OSM) option is designed to teach our students how to manage operations in business and government.
        An operation is the process by which a company or organization converts raw materials, labor and capital into a final product or service.
        In an automobile company, for example, materials and labor are transformed by manufacturing operations into cars. In a hospital, nurses
        and doctors use medicines, care and equipment to help sick patients become healthy.
